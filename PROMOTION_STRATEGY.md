```
Show HN: Corporate Network Access Solution – Secure VPN access to home infrastructure
```

#### Show HN Description:
```
I've been managing network infrastructure remotely through various corporate firewalls (Zscaler, Fortinet, etc.) and decided to document and automate the complete solution.

The core problem: You have servers, lab equipment, or network infrastructure at home that you need to manage from your corporate workstation, but enterprise proxies block most VPN solutions.

My approach uses a dual VPN strategy (Tailscale + ZeroTier) with different protocols, so at least one will work through most corporate environments. I've also integrated an AI assistant (Claude) for automated network management tasks.

What's included:
- Automated setup scripts for the entire environment
- Corporate IT approval documentation and templates
- Security compliance guides
- AI assistant with persistent memory for network management
- Support for major network vendors (Fortinet, Cisco, generic SNMP)

Currently using this to manage 812+ network devices across 7 organizations remotely. The solution has proven reliable across different corporate network environments.

The repository includes everything needed to deploy this yourself, along with detailed documentation for getting corporate IT approval (which is often the biggest hurdle).

Looking for feedback from other network professionals who face similar challenges.
