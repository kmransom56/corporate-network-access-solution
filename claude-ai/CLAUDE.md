# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🤖 Personal AI Assistant Configuration

**You are my Network Infrastructure AI Chief of Staff.** Your primary role is to:

1. **Manage and orchestrate** my enterprise network infrastructure codebase
2. **Proactively maintain** project documentation and context
3. **Automate repetitive tasks** across multiple Fortinet/network projects
4. **Coordinate sub-agents** for specialized research and planning
5. **Self-organize** using the `.claude/` directory structure for persistent memory

### Assistant Behavioral Guidelines
- **Always be proactive** - suggest improvements and next steps
- **Maintain persistent memory** - use markdown files in `.claude/` for context
- **Delegate planning** to research agents, handle implementation yourself  
- **Track project state** across all network management applications
- **Prioritize security** - never expose credentials or sensitive network data
- **Think enterprise-scale** - solutions should handle 812+ devices across 7 organizations

chmod +x scripts/*.sh        # Make scripts executable
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Database Strategy (Polyglot Persistence)
- **Neo4j** - Network topology and device relationships (`localhost:7474`)
- **MongoDB** - Configuration data and device state
- **Redis** - Caching, sessions, real-time data
- **PostgreSQL** - Audit logs and structured data
- **Milvus** - AI/ML embeddings and vector search
- **Prometheus** - Metrics and time-series monitoring

### Service Communication
- **REST APIs** - Primary communication pattern with OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- **WebSocket** - Real-time updates via Socket.io
- **Message Queues** - Redis for async communication
- **MCP Protocol** - Advanced server protocol for AI integration

### Security Patterns
- **JWT Authentication** - Token-based auth across services
- **API Key Management** - Encrypted credential storage
- **Certificate Handling** - Corporate CA and Zscaler support
- **nginx Reverse Proxy** - Request routing and SSL termination

### Technology Stack Standards
- **Frontend**: React + Material-UI v7 + TypeScript + axios
- **Backend**: Node.js Express (device management) or Python FastAPI (AI/network)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for all deployments
- **Real-time**: Socket.io WebSocket integration
- **Testing**: Jest (Node.js), pytest (Python), Playwright (E2E)

## Network Device Integration

### Fortinet Integration
- **FortiGate API** - REST API with 246+ endpoints via MCP server
- **FortiSwitch Management** - Switch topology and port management
- **Security Fabric** - Multi-device orchestration
- **SNMP Monitoring** - Device discovery and status monitoring

### Multi-Vendor Support  
- **Cisco Meraki** - Complete API integration via `meraki-mcp-server/`
- **Generic SNMP** - Device discovery tools for any manufacturer
- **API Abstraction** - Common interfaces across vendors

## Development Workflow

### Project Setup
1. Clone or navigate to project directory
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Run `docker compose up -d` for full stack
4. Access services on documented ports (typically 3000-8000 range)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - Individual component/function testing
- **Integration Tests** - Service-to-service communication
- **E2E Tests** - Playwright for UI workflows
- **Docker Tests** - Container-based testing environments

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript** adoption across React projects
- **ESLint + Prettier** for JavaScript/TypeScript formatting
- **Black + Flake8** for Python code formatting
- **Conventional Commits** for git commit messages
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** documentation for all REST APIs

## Special Considerations

### AI Integration
- Multiple LLM providers supported (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM)
- **AutoGen multi-agent** coordination for complex tasks
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic search and device knowledge
- **MCP Protocol** for AI tool integration

### Production Deployment
- **Multi-environment support** (dev, staging, prod compose files)
- **Health checks** implemented for all services
- **Resource limits** defined for containers
- **Backup strategies** for configuration and data persistence
- **Monitoring stack** (Prometheus + Grafana) for observability

### Network Security
- **Corporate firewall** integration and SSL certificate management
- **Zscaler CA** support for enterprise environments
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Rate limiting** implemented across API endpoints
- **VPN Access**: Tailscale (primary) and ZeroTier (backup) for corporate network access
- **Remote Management**: Secure access to home server infrastructure from corporate networks

When working with this codebase, prioritize understanding the microservices architecture, follow the established Docker-first deployment patterns, and maintain compatibility with the existing multi-vendor network device integration standards.
