# FortiGate API Access Issues - RESOLVED DIAGNOSIS
Issue: Authentication failing across all methods (SSH, HTTPS, REST API)
Root Cause: Credentials may be incorrect or API access disabled
‚úÖ HTTPS works on port 8443 (not standard 443)
‚úÖ Updated .env file with correct port
‚ùå Authentication failing - requires console access to reset
Solution: Manual configuration via console access required
