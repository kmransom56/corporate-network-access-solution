### Infrastructure Overview
- **Total Projects**: 40+ in repositories/ directory
- **Database Stack**: Neo4j (topology), MongoDB (config), Redis (cache), PostgreSQL (audit)
- **Container Strategy**: Docker Compose for all deployments
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM with AutoGen coordination
- **Network Scope**: Multi-vendor (Fortinet primary, Cisco Meraki secondary)

### Current Challenges
1. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple database systems need better coordination
2. **Scale Management**: 812+ devices require more efficient batch operations
3. **Real-time Performance**: Dashboard updates need optimization
4. **Documentation Debt**: Several projects need updated READMEs
5. **Corporate Network Access**: Secure remote access from corporate networks behind Zscaler

### Opportunities for AI Assistant Automation
1. **Code Generation**: Consistent API endpoint patterns across projects
2. **Documentation**: Auto-update project READMEs based on code changes
3. **Testing**: Generate comprehensive test suites for new features
4. **Deployment**: Streamline Docker compose configurations
5. **Monitoring**: Proactive alerting on project health issues

## Memory Management Strategy

This file serves as the central context for all AI assistant interactions. Update this file whenever:
- New projects are added or status changes
- Architecture decisions are made
- Development priorities shift
- Integration challenges are identified
- Performance bottlenecks are discovered

The AI assistant should reference this context for all decision-making and proactively suggest updates when project state changes are detected.
