## Weekly Review Schedule

**Every Monday**: Review and update current priorities  
**Every Wednesday**: Check progress on high-priority tasks  
**Every Friday**: Plan next week's focus areas and delegate research tasks

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: Dashboard loads <2 seconds with 1000+ devices
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime across all production services
3. **Documentation**: All projects have comprehensive, up-to-date README files
4. **Security**: Zero exposed credentials or security vulnerabilities
5. **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage across critical network management functions

## AI Assistant Integration

This priority list should be:
- **Referenced** before starting any new development work
- **Updated** whenever project status changes or new issues arise  
- **Used for planning** research agent tasks and command automation
- **Integrated** with deployment and analysis workflows

The AI assistant should proactively:
- Monitor progress on high-priority tasks
- Suggest when to escalate blocked items
- Recommend resource allocation based on priorities
- Alert when deadlines are approaching
- Update project context based on task completion
